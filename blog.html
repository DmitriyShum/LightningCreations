I also make videos on my youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/dmitriyshum7" target="_blank">Here.</a> Today is also National Periodic Table Day! I have a Periodic Table of Music Genres on my wall, but I am also interested in science which gives my a reason to celebrate!</p></ul>
  <ul><p class="content">2/8/21: Making another video today for Youtube, glad I could post yesterday as well. I got a lot of snow yesterday, and now it's sunny so the snow is melting quick. Most likely staying inside all day with the homework I have to do. Hope you enjoy your day, and I will post a video in about 8-9 hours :)</p></ul>
