<p>Plastic material is everywhere. Spoons, forks, knives, plates, and other tools for eating are being used all over the world and are causing pollution. We are able to re-use many plastic in many ways. Articles write that people will be rebuilding/fixing roads with melted plastic in the near future.
<p>By melting a spoon, I was able to make liquid plastic that will stick easily to anything. Using basic tools such as a lighter, pliers, sanding paper, I was able to fill the cavity in the piece of a wooden board by pushing and flattening the melted plastic with my pliers.</p>
